Racket is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm PL based on the Scheme dialect of Lisp. It is known as a language-oriented programming language and frequently used by various institutions for PL design and implementation. 

It is also used for scripting, Computer Science education and research purposes. Racket is a great PL used for Programming language theory (PLT) which deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages and of their individual features.

First of all, please download Racket: https://download.racket-lang.org/ and install DrRocket or if you prefer, 

initially try an online editor, e.g.: https://onecompiler.com/racket/.

In this project Ä± wrote a simple interpreter for postfix arithmetic expression
